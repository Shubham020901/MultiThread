In a modern web application, the web server must handle multiple client requests concurrently to ensure efficient processing and timely responses. 
This capability is crucial for maintaining performance and scalability, especially under high-load conditions. 
The goal is to design and implement a multi-threaded web server that can handle concurrent client requests effectively.

**Requirements:**
**Concurrent Request Handling:**

The web server must be able to accept and process multiple client requests simultaneously.
Each client request should be handled by a separate thread to ensure that the server can process multiple requests in parallel without waiting for one to complete before starting another.

**Thread Management:**

Use a thread pool to manage threads efficiently. This helps in reusing threads and reduces the overhead of creating and destroying threads.
Implement mechanisms to ensure that the server does not get overwhelmed by too many concurrent requests.

**Client Communication:**

Each thread should be responsible for reading the client's request, processing it, and sending back the appropriate response.
Handle different types of requests, including simple text-based requests and more complex operations.

**Error Handling:**

The server must gracefully handle errors and exceptions, such as client disconnections, malformed requests, and internal processing errors.
Log errors appropriately for troubleshooting and analysis.

**Shutdown Mechanism:**

Implement a mechanism to safely shut down the server, ensuring that all active threads complete their current tasks before termination.
